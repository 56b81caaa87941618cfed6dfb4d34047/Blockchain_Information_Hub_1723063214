Additionally, the user was presented with various optional features for the navbar, such as sticky headers, dropdown menus, search functionality, a theme toggle switch, live chat support, and responsive design elements, indicating preferences for some features while opting out of others.\n\nFollowing this, the user again specified the addition of a \"Hello World\" button, which the AI acknowledged and confirmed it would integrate. The AI then asked the user additional questions regarding the button's placement and the function it should perform when clicked. Meanwhile, further optional features related to the \"Hello World\" button were proposed, including customizable themes, social media sharing, animations, multilingual support, message customization, and voice feedback, with the user showing interest in some features while declining others. The AI concluded by requesting more details about the project for further assistance.",

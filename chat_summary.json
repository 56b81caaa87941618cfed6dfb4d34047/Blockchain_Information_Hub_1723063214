Some features were checked as implemented, while others were not. The user also requested a button that says \"Hello World,\" to which the AI responded positively, affirming its addition.\n\nFollowing this, the AI asked the user for more details about the project and posed specific questions regarding the positioning of the \"Hello World\" button and its intended function when clicked. The user was given options such as centering the button or placing it in the bottom right corner and whether the button should display a message or navigate to a new page.
